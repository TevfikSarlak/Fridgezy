Fridgezy is a web application that helps users make the most out of the ingredients available in their fridge. It provides suggestions, tips, and recipes based on the ingredients provided, as well as highlights missing ingredients for specific meals and unused ingredients. The app also offers authentication features to save recipes, and in the future, it will include image upload and image recognition capabilities. Additionally, Fridgezy will introduce two upcoming features: shopping list and my fridge.

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Suggestions**: Users can input the ingredients they have in their fridge and receive suggestions and recipes based on those ingredients.
- **Missing Ingredients**: Fridgezy identifies the missing ingredients needed for a specific recipe and provides recommendations for completing the dish.
- **Unused Ingredients**: The app suggests recipes and ideas for using up unused ingredients to reduce food waste.
- **Authentication (Upcoming)**: Users can create accounts, log in, and save their favorite recipes for future reference.
- **Image Upload (Upcoming)**: Users will be able to upload images of dishes they want to cook, and the app will provide recipes based on the uploaded image.
- **Image Recognition (Upcoming)**: Fridgezy will utilize image recognition technology to analyze images of ingredients in the user's fridge and suggest recipes based on those ingredients.
- **Shopping List (Upcoming)**: Users will be able to create and manage a shopping list within the app, making it easier to note the ingredients they need to buy.
- **My Fridge (Upcoming)**: Fridgezy will introduce a feature that allows users to save the contents of their fridge, enabling them to view and manage their inventory whenever they open the app.
